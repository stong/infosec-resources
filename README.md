# List of InfoSec resources

I get this question a lot so I compiled a big list that I can just link people to directly.

# Where to start?

- [How to start hacking? The ultimate two path guide to information security. - /r/hacking](https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/a3oicn/how_to_start_hacking_the_ultimate_two_path_guide/)
- [LiveOverflow's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcE-kVhqyiHCcjYwcpfj9w)
- [Advice for young hackers. How to teach yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ejj2aBG5c8)

# CTFs

If you are new, you should start with high school level and eventually level up to college level.

- https://ctftime.org - Find CTFs and write-ups
- https://picoctf.com/ (high school level)
- NSA Codebreaker challenge
- CSAW RED (high school level) - Formerly known as CSAW HSF
- CSAW CTF (college level)
- HackTheBox - I never did this, but it's popular

# Binary Exploitation

- [Gatech Sslab CS 6265: InfoSec Lab](https://tc.gts3.org/cs6265/2021/) - GREAT resource on intro to binex.
- [how2heap](https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap) - intro to glibc heap exploitation
- [Dhaval Kapil's heap explotation guide](https://heap-exploitation.dhavalkapil.com/) - intro to glibc heap exploitation. slightly outdated but still good
- http://pwnable.kr/ - Great resource and created by my former colleague [Daehee87](https://daehee87.github.io/)
- http://pwnable.tw/ - more pwnables

# Game hacking and reversing

- [Pointers for REAL dummies](http://alumni.cs.ucr.edu/~pdiloren/C++_Pointers/) - This is how I finally understood pointers when I was 12 years old. GREAT guide and it will teach you about C and what is memory.
- [Fl33p's CS:S bunnyhop hack tutorial (YT)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiS-j_ecG0A) - A bit outdated but this is what helped me finally understand how to use a debugger and Cheat Engine and Visual Studio. The explanations are not 100% accurate but most importantly it is really beginner friendly for noobs
- [godbolt.org Compiler Explorer](godbolt.org/) - Good to learn what code looks like when it gets compiled
- [Reverse Engineering Stack Exchange](reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/) - Good place to figure out how to do something in IDA Pro.
- [osdev wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page) - Has some outdated or inaccurate info, but usually a good starting point.
