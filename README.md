# List of InfoSec resources

I get this question a lot so I compiled a big list that I can just link people to directly.

Submissions are welcome. Please make a PR and I will try to get around to it when I have time.

# Where to start?

- [LiveOverflow's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcE-kVhqyiHCcjYwcpfj9w)
- [Advice for young hackers. How to teach yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ejj2aBG5c8)
- [How to start hacking? The ultimate two path guide to information security. - /r/hacking](https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/a3oicn/how_to_start_hacking_the_ultimate_two_path_guide/)

# CTFs

If you are new, you should start with high school level and eventually level up to college level.

- https://ctftime.org - Find CTFs and write-ups
- https://picoctf.com/ (high school level)
- NSA Codebreaker challenge
- CSAW RED (high school level) - Formerly known as CSAW HSF
- CSAW CTF (college level)

- [Flare-On](https://flare-on.com/): Annual reversing CTF
- PlaidCTF (warning: hard)
- AngstromCTF, TJCTF, UMDCTF, TUCTF, UIUCTF. Look for CTFs organized by college students or people somewhat above your skill level but not too far
- Other great CTFs in no particular order, some may be missing (may be hard): DiceCTF, Sekai CTF, Midnight Sun CTF, Google CTF, Blue Water CTF
- [CyberPython](https://pythoncyber.go.ro) A hands on learning platform in CTF style
